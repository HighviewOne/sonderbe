export const faqData = [
  {
    question: "How long do I have before my home is foreclosed in California?",
    answer: "In California, the foreclosure process typically takes 120+ days from the first missed payment. You'll receive a Notice of Default after 90 days of missed payments, then have 90 days to cure the default before a Notice of Sale is filed. Even after that, you have at least 21 days before the sale. However, don't wait—the sooner you act, the more options you'll have."
  },
  {
    question: "Will foreclosure completely ruin my credit?",
    answer: "A foreclosure will significantly impact your credit score, typically causing a drop of 100-150 points. It remains on your credit report for 7 years. However, many people begin rebuilding their credit within 2-3 years and can qualify for new home loans in 3-7 years depending on the loan type. The impact lessens over time, especially if you maintain good credit habits afterward."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I stop foreclosure once it has started?",
    answer: "Yes, you can stop foreclosure at various stages in California. Options include loan modification, forbearance, repayment plans, refinancing, selling the home, or in some cases, filing for bankruptcy. Even up to 5 days before the sale, you may be able to reinstate your loan by paying all past-due amounts. Contact your lender immediately to discuss options."
  },
  {
    question: "What is a loan modification and how do I qualify?",
    answer: "A loan modification permanently changes the terms of your mortgage to make payments more affordable. This might include reducing your interest rate, extending the loan term, or adding missed payments to the loan balance. To qualify, you typically need to demonstrate financial hardship, have a steady income, and show that you can afford the modified payment. Contact your lender's loss mitigation department to apply."
  },
  {
    question: "Is refinancing an option if I'm behind on payments?",
    answer: "Refinancing while behind on payments is challenging but not impossible. Traditional refinancing typically requires you to be current on payments. However, some government programs and specialized lenders work with homeowners who are behind. FHA and VA loans may have special options. It's worth exploring, especially if you have significant equity in your home."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a short sale and foreclosure?",
    answer: "In a short sale, you sell your home for less than what you owe with your lender's approval. This typically has less credit impact than foreclosure (50-100 points less), you may avoid a deficiency judgment, and you can often buy a new home sooner. The process requires lender approval and can take 3-6 months, but it gives you more control than foreclosure."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I avoid foreclosure scams?",
    answer: "Be wary of anyone who guarantees to stop your foreclosure, asks for upfront fees before providing services, tells you to stop communicating with your lender, or asks you to sign over your property deed. Legitimate housing counselors through HUD are free. Never sign documents you don't understand, and verify any company through the California Department of Real Estate."
  },
  {
    question: "Can bankruptcy stop foreclosure?",
    answer: "Filing for bankruptcy triggers an automatic stay that temporarily halts foreclosure proceedings. Chapter 13 bankruptcy can help you catch up on missed payments over 3-5 years while keeping your home. Chapter 7 may only delay foreclosure temporarily. Bankruptcy has significant long-term consequences, so consult with a bankruptcy attorney to understand if it's right for your situation."
